Description: 
    The NanoStringExperiment class was inherited from the SummarizedExperiment 
    class. It was designed to encapsulate data and corresponding methods for 
    data generated from NanoString platforms. This class serves as an 
    intermediary class between SummarizedExperiment and NanoString 
    platform-specific classes such as the NanoStringGeoMxSet class from the
    GeomxTools package. This package is meant to congregate common structures 
    and methods to be used for extension to NanoString platform-specific 
    packages.
